## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Play the project** in the Unity Editor.
2. **Provide a CSV file** with the tree data output from standSIM.  
   - An example CSV is included in the root of the project ‚Äî you can use it to test the visualization.
3. **Set the parsing interval** using the input box.  
   - For example, entering `5` will only parse data every 5 years.
4. **Parsed data** will be displayed in a draggable table.
5. **Navigate through years** using the arrow keys.  
   - Left arrow (`‚Üê`): Previous year.  
   - Right arrow (`‚Üí`): Next year.  
   - Note: If it doesn't go immediately to the next year its because there was an occurence in that year.
6. **Enter 3D mode** by pressing `Space`.
7. **In 3D mode**, you can:
   - Zoom in: `Z`  
   - Zoom out: `X`
